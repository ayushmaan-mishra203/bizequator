            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A Drug Licence is a legal authorization granted by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) or State Drugs Control Authorities for the manufacturing, selling, and distribution of drugs in India. It ensures that drugs comply with safety and regulatory standards, and it is mandatory for individuals or entities involved in the pharmaceutical industry.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The licence is issued based on the type of drug activity being carried outâ€”whether it is for wholesale or retail distribution, manufacturing, or export. Different licenses are required for each activity, and they must be renewed periodically.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Drug licenses are issued under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and are governed by the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.
