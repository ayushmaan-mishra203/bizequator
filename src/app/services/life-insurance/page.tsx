            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company in which the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum amount (the death benefit) to a beneficiary in case of the policyholder's death. Life insurance helps provide financial security to the policyholder's family in the event of unforeseen circumstances.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              There are various types of life insurance policies, including term life insurance, whole life insurance, and unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs), each offering different benefits and coverage options.
