            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A partnership is a business structure where two or more individuals come together to conduct business with a shared goal of making profits. Partners share the responsibilities, profits, and liabilities of the business.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Partnership registration formalizes the agreement between partners and ensures that their business operations are legally recognized. It is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses that benefit from shared decision-making.
