            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A Private Limited Company is a business entity that is privately owned, with a limited liability for its shareholders. It is one of the most preferred business structures due to its legal protection, ability to raise capital, and potential for growth.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A private limited company can have a minimum of two shareholders and a maximum of fifty shareholders. The liability of the shareholders is limited to the extent of their shareholding in the company.
